## Setting up AWS Cognito & Amplify

After setting up a User Pool in AWS Cognito, please do the following:

1. Generate a public key:
`yarn prepare-pems --region region --userPoolId userPoolId`

`region`, `userPoolId` - get from AWS Cognito.

This will generate `pem.json` file, which can be commited to the repo.

2. Create `next.config.js` file for configurations and add the data
from User Pool, like `IDP_DOMAIN`, `USER_POOL_ID`, `USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID`.

3. Now you can use AWS Amplify API.
